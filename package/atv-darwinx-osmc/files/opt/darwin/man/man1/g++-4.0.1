.PP
Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.PP
In Apple's version of \s-1GCC\s0, both \fBcc\fR and \fBgcc\fR are actually
symbolic links to a compiler named like gcc\-\fIversion\fR; which compiler
is linked to may be changed using the command \fBgcc_select\fR.
Similarly, \fBc++\fR and \fBg++\fR are links to a compiler named like
g++\-\fIversion\fR.
.PP
Note that Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 includes a number of extensions to standard \s-1GCC\s0
(flagged below with ``\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0''), and that not all generic \s-1GCC\s0
options are available or supported on Darwin / Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  In particular,
Apple does not currently support the compilation of Fortran, Ada, or
Java, although there are third parties who have made these work.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC\s0, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The ``overall options'' allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dr\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-r\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example, \fB\-fforce\-mem\fR,
\&\fB\-fstrength\-reduce\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

.Sh "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

Save debug info in separate object file.
This is available only while building \s-1PCH\s0 in \-gfull mode.
.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
.Sp
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, etc., with \fB.s\fR.
.Sp
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
.Sp
Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Place output in file \fIfile\fR.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
.Sp
If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI.gch\fR, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4
.IX Item "-###"
Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.
.IP "\fB\-pipe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pipe"
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler has
no trouble.
.IP "\fB\-combine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-combine"
If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver
to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for those
languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This will allow
intermodule analysis (\s-1IMA\s0) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for
multiple languages to the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke
the compiler(s) that support \s-1IMA\s0 once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
\&\s-1IMA\s0 this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for
each source file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction
with \fB\-save\-temps\fR, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files
(one for each source file), but only one (combined) \fI.o\fR or
\&\fI.s\fR file.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by \fBgcc\fR.  If the \fB\-v\fR option is also specified
then \fB\-\-help\fR will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by \fBgcc\fR, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the \fB\-Wextra\fR option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of target specific command
line options for each tool.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked \s-1GCC\s0.
.Sh "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling  Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR or \fB.H\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, \*(C+ programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the \*(C+ language\-\-\-and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs or header files from
standard input, or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as \*(C+
programs.  You might also like to precompile a C header file with a
\&\fB.h\fR extension to be used in \*(C+ compilations.  \fBg++\fR is a
program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 with the default language set to \*(C+, and
automatically specifies linking against the \*(C+ library.  On many
systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.
.Sh "Options Controlling C Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling C Dialect"
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+) that the compiler
accepts:
.IP "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, support all \s-1ISO\s0 C90 programs.  In \*(C+ mode,
remove \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that conflict with \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO\s0 C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-pedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.  
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C (such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in

Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the

previous C standards.  For example, you may use \f(CW\*(C`_\|_restrict_\|_\*(C'\fR even
when \fB\-std=c99\fR is not specified.

Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions

Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (\fBI\fR, \fBN\fR for new or
\&\fBO\fR for old, respectively, in the first character after the line

Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR
instead.  \fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-asm\fR.
.Sp
In \*(C+, this switch only affects the \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keyword, since
\&\f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (\fB\-std=c99\fR or \fB\-std=gnu99\fR), this
switch only affects the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, since

.IX Item "-fno-builtin-function"
.PD
Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
\&\fB_\|_builtin_\fR as prefix.  
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in, and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is
known not to modify global memory.
.Sp
With the \fB\-fno\-builtin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option
only the built-in function \fIfunction\fR is
disabled.  \fIfunction\fR must not begin with \fB_\|_builtin_\fR.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of \s-1GCC\s0, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
\&\fB\-fbuiltin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR or
\&\fB\-ffreestanding\fR, you may define macros such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2

type of \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-freestanding\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffreestanding\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffreestanding"
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  The most obvious example is an \s-1OS\s0 kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-hosted\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fnon\-lvalue\-assign\fR" 4

C and \*(C+ forbid the use of casts and conditional expressions as lvalues, e.g.:

.Vb 3
\&        float *p, q, r;
\&        ((int *)p)++;
\&        (cond ? q : r) = 3.0;
.Ve
.Sp
As a transitional measure, the Apple version of \s-1GCC\s0 4.0 allows casts and 
conditional expressions to be used as lvalues in certain situations.  This
is accomplished via the \fB\-fnon\-lvalue\-assign\fR switch, which is on
by default.  Whenever an lvalue cast or an lvalue conditional expression is
encountered, the compiler will issue a deprecation warning and then rewrite
the expression as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        (type)expr                ---becomes--->      *(type *)&expr
\&        cond ? expr1 : expr2      ---becomes--->      *(cond ? &expr1 : &expr2)
.Ve
.Sp
To disallow lvalue casts and lvalue conditional expressions altogether, 
specify \fB\-fno\-non\-lvalue\-assign\fR; lvalue casts and lvalue conditional
expressions will be disallowed in future versions of Apple's \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\-funsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
.IP "\fB\-fsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be signed, like \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Note that this is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-unsigned\-char\fR, which is
the negative form of \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.  Likewise, the option
\&\fB\-fno\-signed\-char\fR is equivalent to \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either \f(CW\*(C`signed\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned\*(C'\fR.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR are signed types.

.Sh "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling  Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs; but you can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`firstClass.C\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
.Ve
.PP
In this example, only \fB\-frepo\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Version 2 is the version of the
\&\*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.
Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0 will change as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs
are fixed.
.Sp
The default is version 2.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-access\-control\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-access-control"
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR will only return \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconserve\-space\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconserve-space"
Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after \f(CW\*(C`main()\*(C'\fR has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.
.Sp
This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into \s-1BSS\s0 without making them common.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-const\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-const-strings"
Give string constants type \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR instead of type \f(CW\*(C`const
char *\*(C'\fR.  By default, G++ uses type \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR as required by
the standard.  Even if you use \fB\-fno\-const\-strings\fR, you cannot
actually modify the value of a string constant, unless you also use
\&\fB\-fwritable\-strings\fR.
.Sp
This option might be removed in a future release of G++.  For maximum
portability, you should structure your code so that it works with
string constants that have type \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't check for violation of exception specifications at runtime.  This
option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful for reducing code
size in production builds, much like defining \fB\s-1NDEBUG\s0\fR.  The compiler
will still optimize based on the exception specifications.
.IP "\fB\-ffor\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffor-scope"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-for-scope"
.PD
If \fB\-ffor\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR is limited to the \fBfor\fR loop itself,
as specified by the \*(C+ standard.
If \fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of \*(C+.
.Sp
The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-keywords"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR instead.
\&\fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-templates"
Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-inline\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-inline-templates"
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and

.IP "\fB\-fno\-implement\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implement-inlines"
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by \fB#pragma implementation\fR.  This will cause linker

synonyms as keywords.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-optional\-diags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optional-diags"
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to

a name having multiple meanings within a class.
.IP "\fB\-fpermissive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpermissive"
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to

.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ runtime type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts

exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed.

.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth\-\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth-n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO\s0 \*(C+
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-threadsafe\-statics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-threadsafe-statics"
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+
\&\s-1ABI\s0 for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread\-safe.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-cxa\-atexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-get\-exception\-ptr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This
will cause \f(CW\*(C`std::uncaught_exception\*(C'\fR to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
were taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO\s0.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behaviour of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly.  Normally if there is a class with default
visibility which has a hidden method, the effect of this is that the
method must be defined in only one shared object.  This switch does
not have this restriction.
.Sp
You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-ms\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-ms-compat"
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make \s-1GCC\s0's \*(C+
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
.Sp
The flag makes these changes to \s-1GCC\s0's linkage model:
.Sp
1. It sets the default visibility to 'hidden', like 
\&\fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR.
2. Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
3. The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications which are defined in more than one different
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they would have
been permitted when this option was not used.
.Sp
This option is discouraged, rather, it is preferable for types to be
explicitly exported as desired on a per-class basis.  Unfortunately
because Visual Studio can't compare two different hidden types as
unequal for the purposes of type_info and exception handling, users
are able to write code that relies upon this behavior.
.Sp
Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects will be different, so changing one will not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared

.IP "\fB\-fno\-weak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-weak"
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This

it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-nostdinc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc++"
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to

.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not assume \fBinline\fR for functions defined inside a class scope.
  Note that these

inlined by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wabi\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wabi ( only)"
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.
.Sp
You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
.Sp
The known incompatibilities at this point include:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit\-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
\&        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will place \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as\f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "*" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "*" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        struct B {
\&          A a;
\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ will place the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.
.IP "*" 4
Names of template functions whose types involve \f(CW\*(C`typename\*(C'\fR or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        template <typename Q>
\&        void f(typename Q::X) {}
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        template <template <typename> class Q>
\&        void f(typename Q<int>::X) {}
.Ve
.Sp
Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-null\-sentinel\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-null-sentinel ( only)"
Warn also about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined
to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_null\*(C'\fR.  Although it is a null pointer constant not a null pointer,
it is guaranteed to of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is
not portable across different compilers.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
\&\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-cast\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-cast ( only)"
Warn if an old-style (C\-style) cast to a non-void type is used within

unintended effects and much easier to search for.
.IP "\fB\-Woverloaded\-virtual\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4

Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a

.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3

the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR class version of \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR is hidden in \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR, and code
like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        B* b;

.Ve
.Sp
will fail to compile.

Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-promo\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-promo ( only)"
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
.Sp
.Vb 4

In this example, G++ will synthesize a default \fBA& operator =

.Sh "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialects"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective- Dialects"
(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
languages themselves.  See 
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1

In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, will override the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[receiver message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime
to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 and later.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method that will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method that will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods
thusly generated will only operate on instance variables declared in the
current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from superclasses.  It
is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods
in an object's inheritance hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods
will be invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object
instance is allocated; the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods will
be invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.

The \f(CW@throw\fR statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective\-\*(C+ program; when used inside of a \f(CW@catch\fR block, the
\&\f(CW@throw\fR may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the \f(CW@catch\fR will be rethrown.
.Sp
Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest \f(CW@catch\fR clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR blocks work in \*(C+ and Java.  A
\&\f(CW\*(C`@catch(id ...)\*(C'\fR clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous \f(CW@catch\fR
clauses (if any).
.Sp
The \f(CW@finally\fR clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section, analogously to the behavior
of the \f(CW\*(C`finally\*(C'\fR clause in Java.
.Sp
There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Although currently designed to be binary compatible with \f(CW\*(C`NS_HANDLER\*(C'\fR\-style
idioms provided by the \f(CW\*(C`NSException\*(C'\fR class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.
.IP "*" 4
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective\-\*(C+, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with \*(C+
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot \f(CW@throw\fR an exception
from Objective-C and \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR it in \*(C+, or vice versa
(i.e., \f(CW\*(C`throw ... @catch\*(C'\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The \fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&          @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
\&            ...
\&          }
.Ve
.Sp
Upon entering the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR available to other threads).
.Sp
Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.
.RE

Enable garbage collection (\s-1GC\s0) for Objective-C objects.  The resulting binary

.Sp
When the \fB\-fobjc\-gc\fR switch is specified, the compiler will replace
assignments to instance variables (ivars) and to certain kinds of pointers to
Objective-C object instances with calls to interceptor functions provided
by the runtime garbage collector.  Two type qualifiers, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_strong\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_weak\*(C'\fR, also become available.  The \f(CW\*(C`_\|_strong\*(C'\fR qualifier may be
used to indicate that assignments to variables of this type should generate
a \s-1GC\s0 interceptor call, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&          __strong void *p;  // assignments to 'p' will have interceptor calls

\&          (__strong int *)q = 0;   // this assignment will call an interceptor
.Ve
.Sp
Conversely, the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_weak\*(C'\fR type qualifier may be used to suppress
interceptor call generation:

Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow \fB\f(BIdyld\fB\|(1)\fR to load it in at

.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-protocol"
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
.IP "\fB\-Wselector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wselector"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the \fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR option is
being used.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-selector\-match\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-selector-match"
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Class\*(C'\fR.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types which share the same size

.IP "\fB\-Wundeclared\-selector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundeclared-selector"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no

\&\f(CW@interface\fR or \f(CW@protocol\fR declaration, or implicitly in
an \f(CW@implementation\fR section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression is found,
while \fB\-Wselector\fR only performs its checks in the final stage of

that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

.Sh "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
.IX Subsection "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the \*(C+ front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.
.IP "\fB\-fmessage\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmessage-length=n"
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about \fIn\fR
characters.  The default is 72 characters for \fBg++\fR and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by \s-1GCC\s0.  If \fIn\fR is zero, then no
line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=once"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit \fIonce\fR source location information; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=every\-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
.Sh "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning \fB\-W\fR,
for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings;
for example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
.PP
The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by \s-1GCC\s0; for further, language-specific options also refer to
\&\fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and \fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect
Options\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsyntax-only"
Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+.  For \s-1ISO\s0 C, follows the
version of the \s-1ISO\s0 C standard specified by any \fB\-std\fR option used.
.Sp
Valid \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO\s0 C).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-pedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-pedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO\s0
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C \fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO\s0 C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-pedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu89\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO\s0 C on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-pedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU\s0
C dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Like \fB\-pedantic\fR, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Inhibit all warning messages.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-import\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-import"
Inhibit warning messages about the use of \fB#import\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-#warnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-#warnings"
Inhibit warning messages issued by \fB#warning\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wpragma\-once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpragma-once"
Warn about the use of \fB#pragma once\fR.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.IP "\fB\-Wextra\-tokens\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wextra-tokens"
Warn about extra tokens at the end of prepreprocessor directives.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.IP "\fB\-Wnewline\-eof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnewline-eof"
Warn about files missing a newline at the end of the file.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-altivec\-long\-deprecated\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-altivec-long-deprecated"
Do not warn about the use of the deprecated 'long' keyword in
AltiVec data types.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.IP "\fB\-Wchar\-subscripts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wchar-subscripts"
Warn if an array subscript has type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfatal-errors"
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat"
Check calls to \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes, in the \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`strfmon\*(C'\fR (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
\&\fB\-ffreestanding\fR or \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR.
.Sp
The formats are checked against the format features supported by \s-1GNU\s0
libc version 2.2.  These include all \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some \s-1BSD\s0 and \s-1GNU\s0
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; \s-1GCC\s0 does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if \fB\-pedantic\fR is used
with \fB\-Wformat\fR, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for \f(CW\*(C`strfmon\*(C'\fR formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  
.Sp
Since \fB\-Wformat\fR also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, \fB\-Wformat\fR also implies \fB\-Wnonnull\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wformat\fR is included in \fB\-Wall\fR.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options \fB\-Wformat\-y2k\fR,
\&\fB\-Wno\-format\-extra\-args\fR, \fB\-Wno\-format\-zero\-length\fR,
\&\fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR, \fB\-Wformat\-security\fR, and
\&\fB\-Wformat=2\fR are available, but are not included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-y2k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-y2k"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, also warn about \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR
formats which may yield only a two-digit year.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-format\-extra\-args\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-format-extra-args"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.
.Sp
Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with \fB$\fR operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to \f(CW\*(C`va_arg\*(C'\fR to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-format\-zero\-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-format-zero-length"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-nonliteral"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a \f(CW\*(C`va_list\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-security\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-security"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in \f(CW\*(C`printf (foo);\*(C'\fR.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains \fB%n\fR.  (This is
currently a subset of what \fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to \fB\-Wformat\-security\fR that are not
included in \fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR.)
.IP "\fB\-Wformat=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat=2"
Enable \fB\-Wformat\fR plus format checks not included in
\&\fB\-Wformat\fR.  Currently equivalent to \fB\-Wformat
\&\-Wformat\-nonliteral \-Wformat\-security \-Wformat\-y2k\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wnonnull\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnonnull"
Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the \f(CW\*(C`nonnull\*(C'\fR function attribute.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wnonnull\fR is included in \fB\-Wall\fR and \fB\-Wformat\fR.  It
can be disabled with the \fB\-Wno\-nonnull\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-Winit\-self\fR (C, \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Winit-self (C, , Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the \fB\-Wuninitialized\fR option,
which in turn only works with \fB\-O1\fR and above.
.Sp
For example, \s-1GCC\s0 will warn about \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when \fB\-Winit\-self\fR has been specified:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        int f()
\&        {
\&          int i = i;
\&          return i;
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-int\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit-int"
Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-function\-declaration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Werror\-implicit\-function\-declaration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror-implicit-function-declaration"
.PD
Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
declared.  The form \fB\-Wno\-error\-implicit\-function\-declaration\fR
is not supported.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR (as a warning, not an error).
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit"
Same as \fB\-Wimplicit\-int\fR and \fB\-Wimplicit\-function\-declaration\fR.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmain"
Warn if the type of \fBmain\fR is suspicious.  \fBmain\fR should be a
function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-braces\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-braces"
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for \fBa\fR is not fully
bracketed, but that for \fBb\fR is fully bracketed.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
\&        int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-include\-dirs\fR (C, \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, , Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.  Only the warning for an assignment used as
a truth value is supported when compiling \*(C+; the other warnings are
only supported when compiling C.
.Sp
Also warn if a comparison like \fBx<=y<=z\fR appears; this is
equivalent to \fB(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\fR, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.Sp
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR
statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 will issue a warning when this flag is specified.
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR could belong to
the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code would look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C standard.
.Sp
The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are
evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent a partial
ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those executed
before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C standard specifies that ``Between the
previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore,
the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be
stored.''.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a[n]
= b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The present implementation of this option only works for C programs.  A
future implementation may also work for \*(C+ programs.
.Sp
The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wreturn\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wreturn-type"
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Also warn about any \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For C, also warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR.  Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the
value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  \s-1ISO\s0 C prohibits
qualified \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR return types on function definitions, so such
return types always receive a warning even without this option.
.Sp
For \*(C+, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when \fB\-Wno\-return\-type\fR is specified.  The only
exceptions are \fBmain\fR and functions defined in system headers.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label prevents this
warning.)  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-default\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-default"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement does not have a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR
case.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-enum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-enum"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of
the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned about).
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-function\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-function"
Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
non\e\-inline static function is unused.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-label\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-label"
Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-parameter"
Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-variable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-variable"
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused
aside from its declaration
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-value\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-value"
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.Sp
To suppress this warning cast the expression to \fBvoid\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
All the above \fB\-Wunused\fR options combined.
.Sp
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify \fB\-Wextra \-Wunused\fR (note that \fB\-Wall\fR implies
\&\fB\-Wunused\fR), or separately specify \fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wuninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or
if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call.
.Sp
These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify \fB\-O\fR, you simply won't
get these warnings.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of \s-1GCC\s0 used.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.Sp
These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {
\&            case 1: x = 1;
\&              break;
\&            case 2: x = 4;
\&              break;
\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        {
\&          int save_y;
\&          if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
\&          ...
\&          if (change_y) y = save_y;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This has no bug because \f(CW\*(C`save_y\*(C'\fR is used only if it is set.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
.Sp
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.  
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunknown-pragmas"
Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by
\&\s-1GCC\s0.  If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the \fB\-Wall\fR command line option.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing=2"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about all code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  This warning catches all cases, but
it will also give a warning for some ambiguous cases that are safe.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
All of the above \fB\-W\fR options combined.  This enables all the
warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and
that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in
conjunction with macros.  This also enables some language-specific
warnings described in \fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and
\&\fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmost\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmost"
This is equivalent to \-Wall \-Wno\-parentheses.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.PP
The following \fB\-W...\fR options are not implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.
Some of them warn about constructions that users generally do not
consider questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check
for; others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid
in some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wextra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wextra"
(This option used to be called \fB\-W\fR.  The older name is still
supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)  Print extra warning
messages for these events:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        foo (a)
\&        {
\&          if (a > 0)
\&            return a;
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "*" 4
An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects.
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.
For example, an expression such as \fBx[i,j]\fR will cause a warning,
but \fBx[(void)i,j]\fR will not.
.IP "*" 4
An unsigned value is compared against zero with \fB<\fR or \fB>=\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Storage-class specifiers like \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.
.IP "*" 4
If \fB\-Wall\fR or \fB\-Wunused\fR is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.
.IP "*" 4
A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
(But don't warn if \fB\-Wno\-sign\-compare\fR is also specified.)
.IP "*" 4
An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members.
This warning can be independently controlled by
\&\fB\-Wmissing\-field\-initializers\fR.
.IP "*" 4
A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&R\-style
functions:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        void foo(bar) { }
.Ve
.IP "*" 4
An empty body occurs in an \fBif\fR or \fBelse\fR statement.
.IP "*" 4
A pointer is compared against integer zero with \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR,
\&\fB>\fR, or \fB>=\fR.
.IP "*" 4
A variable might be changed by \fBlongjmp\fR or \fBvfork\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Any of several floating-point events that often indicate errors, such as
overflow, underflow, loss of precision, etc.
.IP "*<(\*(C+ only)>" 4
.IX Item "*<( only)>"
An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a conditional expression.
.IP "*<(\*(C+ only)>" 4
.IX Item "*<( only)>"
A non-static reference or non-static \fBconst\fR member appears in a

.IP "*<(\*(C+ only)>" 4
.IX Item "*<( only)>"
Ambiguous virtual bases.
.IP "*<(\*(C+ only)>" 4
.IX Item "*<( only)>"
Subscripting an array which has been declared \fBregister\fR.
.IP "*<(\*(C+ only)>" 4
.IX Item "*<( only)>"
Taking the address of a variable which has been declared \fBregister\fR.
.IP "*<(\*(C+ only)>" 4
.IX Item "*<( only)>"
A base class is not initialized in a derived class' copy constructor.
.RE

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-div\-by\-zero\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-div-by-zero"
Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating point
division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of
obtaining infinities and NaNs.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using \fB\-Wall\fR in conjunction with this
option will \fInot\fR warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers\-\-\-for that, \fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR must also be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-equal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-equal"
Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.
.Sp
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
.IP "\fB\-Wfour\-char\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfour-char-constants"
Warn about four char constants, e.g. OSType '\s-1APPL\s0'.  This warning is 
disabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional (C only)"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in \s-1ISO\s0 C.
.IP "*" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize \fB#elif\fR, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.IP "*" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.IP "*" 4
The unary plus operator.
.IP "*" 4
The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the \fBL\fR suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however \s-1GCC\s0's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
.IP "*" 4
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
.IP "*" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an operand of type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR.
.IP "*" 4
A non\-\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR function declaration follows a \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
.IP "*" 4
The \s-1ISO\s0 type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
.IP "*" 4
Usage of \s-1ISO\s0 string concatenation is detected.
.IP "*" 4
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
.IP "*" 4
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
.IP "*" 4
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_\|_\*(C'\fR to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
.IP "*" 4
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use \fB\-Wconversion\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Use of \s-1ISO\s0 C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
\&\fInot\fR issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these \s-1ISO\s0 C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, \f(CW\*(C`PARAMS\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VPARAMS\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a \s-1GCC\s0 extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-Wdeclaration\-after\-statement\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C only)"
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from \*(C+, was introduced with \s-1ISO\s0 C99 and is by default
allowed in \s-1GCC\s0.  It is not supported by \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and was not supported by
\&\s-1GCC\s0 versions before \s-1GCC\s0 3.0.  
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-discard\-qual\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-discard-qual"
This flag allows user to suppress warning that is issued when qualification
is discarded in situations like, initialization, assignment and argument
passing.
.IP "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an \fB#if\fR directive.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-endif\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-endif-labels"
Do not warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow"
Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or
global variable or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.
.IP "\fB\-Wlarger\-than\-\fR\fIlen\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlarger-than-len"
Warn whenever an object of larger than \fIlen\fR bytes is defined.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-arith\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-arith"
Warn about anything that depends on the ``size of'' a function type or
of \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.  \s-1GNU\s0 C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR pointers and pointers
to functions.
.IP "\fB\-Wbad\-function\-cast\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wbad-function-cast (C only)"
Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if \f(CW\*(C`int malloc()\*(C'\fR is cast to \f(CW\*(C`anything *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-qual\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-qual"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR is cast
to an ordinary \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-align"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR is cast to
an \f(CW\*(C`int *\*(C'\fR on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two\- or four-byte boundaries.
.IP "\fB\-Wwrite\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wwrite-strings"
When compiling C, give string constants the type \f(CW\*(C`const
char[\f(CIlength\f(CW]\*(C'\fR so that
copying the address of one into a non\-\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR
pointer will get a warning; when compiling \*(C+, warn about the
deprecated conversion from string constants to \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make \fB\-Wall\fR request these warnings.
.IP "\fB\-Wconversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wconversion"
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
.Sp
Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the assignment
\&\f(CW\*(C`x = \-1\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is unsigned.  But do not warn about explicit
casts like \f(CW\*(C`(unsigned) \-1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wshorten\-64\-to\-32\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshorten-64-to-32"
Warn if a value is implicitly converted from a 64 bit type to a 32 bit type.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-compare"
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR; to get the other warnings
of \fB\-Wextra\fR without this warning, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-sign\-compare\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waggregate\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waggregate-return"
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-prototypes\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-prototypes (C only)"
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-definition\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-definition (C only)"
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-prototypes\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-prototypes (C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-declarations (C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-field\-initializers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-field-initializers"
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`x.h\*(C'\fR is implicitly zero:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { 3, 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification would not trigger a warning:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is included in \fB\-Wextra\fR.  To get other \fB\-Wextra\fR
warnings without this one, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-missing\-field\-initializers\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-noreturn"
Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever return before
adding the \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR attribute, otherwise subtle code generation
bugs could be introduced.  You will not get a warning for \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR in
hosted C environments.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-format\-attribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-format-attribute"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is enabled, also warn about functions which might be
candidates for \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes.  Note these are only possible
candidates, not absolute ones.  \s-1GCC\s0 will guess that \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR
attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls a function
like \f(CW\*(C`vprintf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`vscanf\*(C'\fR, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.  This option has no effect unless
\&\fB\-Wformat\fR is enabled (possibly by \fB\-Wall\fR).
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-multichar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-multichar"
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (\fB'\s-1FOO\s0'\fR) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
This flag does not control warning for a constant with four characters,
use \-Wfour\-char\-constants instead.
.IP "\fB\-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>"
In \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic \s-1ASCII\s0 character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the \s-1ISO\s0 10646 standard sets out some \fInormalization rules\fR which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  \s-1GCC\s0 can warn you if you are using identifiers which
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
.Sp
There are four levels of warning that \s-1GCC\s0 supports.  The default is
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfc\fR, which warns about any identifier which is
not in the \s-1ISO\s0 10646 ``C'' normalized form, \fI\s-1NFC\s0\fR.  \s-1NFC\s0 is the
recommended form for most uses.
.Sp
Unfortunately, there are some characters which \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ allow
in identifiers that when turned into \s-1NFC\s0 aren't allowable as
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C or \*(C+ and have all your identifiers in \s-1NFC\s0.
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=id\fR suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
.Sp
You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=none\fR.  You would only want to do this if you
were using some other normalization scheme (like ``D''), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
.Sp
Some characters in \s-1ISO\s0 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance \f(CW\*(C`\eu207F\*(C'\fR, ``\s-1SUPERSCRIPT\s0 \s-1LATIN\s0 \s-1SMALL\s0
\&\s-1LETTER\s0 N'', will display just like a regular \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR which has been
placed in a superscript.  \s-1ISO\s0 10646 defines the \fI\s-1NFKC\s0\fR
normalisation scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and \s-1GCC\s0 will warn if your code is not in \s-1NFKC\s0 if you use
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfkc\fR.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is
unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-deprecated\-declarations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-deprecated-declarations"
Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types marked as
deprecated by using the \f(CW\*(C`deprecated\*(C'\fR attribute.
(@pxref{Function Attributes}, \f(CW@pxref\fR{Variable Attributes},
\&\f(CW@pxref\fR{Type Attributes}.)
.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked"
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
will be misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        struct foo {
\&          int x;
\&          char a, b, c, d;
\&        } __attribute__((packed));
\&        struct bar {
\&          char z;
\&          struct foo f;
\&        };
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wnested\-externs\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnested-externs (C only)"
Warn if an \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declaration is encountered within a function.
.IP "\fB\-Wunreachable\-code\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunreachable-code"
Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.
.Sp
This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.
.Sp
It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.
.Sp
For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.
.Sp
This option is not made part of \fB\-Wall\fR because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile\-time.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \fBoffsetof\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ standard, applying \fBoffsetof\fR
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \fBoffsetof\fR typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
\&\fBstruct\fR that fails to be a \s-1POD\s0 type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
.Sp
The restrictions on \fBoffsetof\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-pch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-pch"
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlong-long"
Warn if \fBlong long\fR type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR.  Flags
\&\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR and \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR are taken into account
only when \fB\-pedantic\fR flag is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wvariadic\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvariadic-macros"
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic \s-1ISO\s0 C90 mode, or the \s-1GNU\s0
alternate syntax when in pedantic \s-1ISO\s0 C99 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-variadic\-macros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pointer-sign"
Don't warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
Only useful in the negative form since this warning is enabled by default.
This option is only supported for C and Objective\-C.

.Sh "Options for Debugging Your Program or \s-1GCC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or \s-1GCC:\s0
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0, or \s-1DWARF\s0 2).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR or \fB\-gstabs\fR
(see below).
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
.Sp
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.Sp
The following options are useful when \s-1GCC\s0 is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
.IP "\fB\-ggdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggdb"
Produce debugging information for use by \s-1GDB\s0.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (\s-1DWARF\s0 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including \s-1GDB\s0 extensions if at all
possible.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without \s-1GDB\s0 extensions.  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on most \s-1BSD\s0
systems.  On \s-1MIPS\s0, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by \s-1DBX\s0 or \s-1SDB\s0.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler.
.IP "\fB\-flimit\-debug\-info\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flimit-debug-info"
Limit debug information produced to reduce size of debug binary.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs+"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
.IP "\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gdwarf-2"
Produce debugging information in \s-1DWARF\s0 version 2 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on \s-1IRIX\s0 6.  With this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 uses features of \s-1DWARF\s0 version 3 when they are useful;
version 3 is upward compatible with version 2, but may still cause
problems for older debuggers.
.Sp
(Other debug formats, such as \fB\-gcoff\fR, are not supported in
Darwin or Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.)

.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR\fIlevel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabslevel"
.PD
Request debugging information and also use \fIlevel\fR to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
.Sp
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
.Sp
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use \fB\-g3\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
\&\s-1GCC\s0 used to support an option \fB\-gdwarf\fR that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the \s-1DWARF\s0 format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional \fB\-g\fR\fIlevel\fR option to change the
debug level for \s-1DWARF2\s0.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-dwarf2\-dups\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-dwarf2-dups"
Compress \s-1DWARF2\s0 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating \s-1DWARF2\s0 debugging information with \fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the

the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
.IP "\fB\-pg\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-fmem\-report\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmem-report"
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-arcs"
Add code so that program flow \fIarcs\fR are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
\&\fI\fIauxname\fI.gcda\fR for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR), or for
test coverage analysis (\fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR).  Each object file's
\&\fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. \fIfoo.gcda\fR for input file \fIdir/foo.c\fR, or
\&\fIdir/foo.gcda\fR for output file specified as \fB\-o dir/foo.o\fR).

Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
\&\f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).

.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
With \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, for each function of your program \s-1GCC\s0
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-based\-profiling\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-based-profiling"
This option is used in addition to \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR or
\&\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR to control whether those optimizations
are performed on a tree-based or rtl-based internal representation.
If you use this option when compiling with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR,
you must also use it when compiling later with \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR.
Currently the tree-based optimization is in an early stage of
development, and this option is recommended only for those people
working on improving it.
.IP "\fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR" 4

This option provides a seed that \s-1GCC\s0 uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the \fB\-frandom\-seed\fR option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.
.Sp
The \fIstring\fR should be different for every file you compile.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-verbose=n"
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless \fB\-dS\fR or \fB\-dR\fR is
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, \fI.sched\fR or \fI.sched2\fR respectively.  However
for \fIn\fR greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard
error.
.Sp
For \fIn\fR greater than zero, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR outputs the
same information as \fB\-dRS\fR.  For \fIn\fR greater than one, it
also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information
and unit/insn info.  For \fIn\fR greater than two, it includes \s-1RTL\s0
at abort point, control-flow and regions info.  And for \fIn\fR over
four, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR also includes dependence info.
.IP "\fB\-save\-temps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-save-temps"
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR would produce files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.Sp
When used in combination with the \fB\-x\fR command line option,
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.IP "\fB\-time\fR" 4
.IX Item "-time"
Report the \s-1CPU\s0 time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler

\&        # as 0.00 0.01
.Ve
.Sp
The first number on each line is the ``user time'', that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is ``system time'',
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.IP "\fB\-fvar\-tracking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvar-tracking"
Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each

(if the debugging information format supports this information).
.Sp
It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (\fB\-Os\fR,
\&\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-Oz\fR (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0), ...), debugging information (\fB\-g\fR) and
the debug info format supports it.

.IX Item "-print-file-name=library"
Print the full absolute name of the library file \fIlibrary\fR that
would be used when linking\-\-\-and don't do anything else.  With this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multi\-directory\fR" 4

.Sp
This is useful when \fBgcc\fR prints the error message
\&\fBinstallation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory\fR.
To resolve this you either need to put \fIcpp0\fR and the other compiler
components where \fBgcc\fR expects to find them, or you can set the environment

.IP "\fB\-dumpspecs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dumpspecs"
Print the compiler's built-in specs\-\-\-and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when \s-1GCC\s0 itself is being built.)  
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-types"
Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF2\s0 output, \s-1GCC\s0 will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, \s-1GCC\s0 will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
.Sh "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Optimization levels \fB\-O2\fR and above, in
particular, enable \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode, which allows the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in
the file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at
once to a single output file in \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O"

more memory for a large function.
.Sp
With \fB\-O\fR, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
.Sp
\&\fB\-O\fR turns on the following optimization flags:

.Sp
\&\fB\-O\fR doesn't turn on \fB\-ftree\-sra\fR for the Ada compiler.
This option must be explicitly specified on the command line to be

.IP "\fB\-O2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O2"
Optimize even more.  \s-1GCC\s0 performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify \fB\-O2\fR.
As compared to \fB\-O\fR, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

.IP "\fB\-O0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O0"
Do not optimize.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-fast\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fast"
Optimize for maximum performance. \fB\-fast\fR changes the overall optimization 
strategy of \s-1GCC\s0 in order to produce the fastest possible running code for \s-1PPC7450\s0 
and G5 architectures. By default, \fB\-fast\fR optimizes for G5. Programs 
optimized for G5 will not run on \s-1PPC7450\s0. To optimize for \s-1PPC7450\s0, add 
\&\fB\-mcpu=7450\fR on command line.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fast\fR currently enables the following optimization flags (for G5 and \s-1PPC7450\s0). 
These flags may change in the future.  You cannot override any of these options if you use 
\&\fB\-fast\fR except by setting \fB\-mcpu=7450\fR (or \fB\-fPIC\fR, see below).

Important notes: \fB\-ffast\-math\fR results in code that is not necessarily 
IEEE\-compliant.  \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is highly likely break 
non-standard-compliant programs.  \fB\-malign\-natural\fR only works properly if
the entire program is compiled with it, and none of the standard headers/libraries
contain any code that changes alignment when this option is used.
.IP "\fB\-Os\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Os"
Optimize for size, but not at the expense of speed.
\&\fB\-Os\fR enables all \fB\-O2\fR optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  However, instructions
are chosen for best performance, regardless of size.
To optimize solely for size on Darwin, use \fB\-Oz\fR (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0).
.Sp
The following options are set for \fB\-O2\fR, but are disabled under \fB\-Os\fR:
\&\fB\-falign\-functions  \-falign\-jumps  \-falign\-loops 
\&\-falign\-labels  \-freorder\-blocks  \-freorder\-blocks\-and\-partition 
\&\-fprefetch\-loop\-arrays\fR
.Sp
When optimizing with \fB\-Os\fR or \fB\-Oz\fR (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0) on
Darwin, any function up to 30 ``estimated insns'' in size will be
considered for inlining.  When compiling C and Objective-C sourcefiles with
\&\fB\-Os\fR or \fB\-Oz\fR on Darwin, functions explictly marked
with the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword up to 450 ``estimated insns'' in size
will be considered for inlining.
When compiling for Apple \s-1POWERPC\s0 targets, \fB\-Os\fR and
\&\fB\-Oz\fR (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0) disable use of the string instructions even though they
would usually be smaller, because the kernel can't emulate them
correctly in some rare cases.  This behavior is not portable to any
other gcc environment, and will not affect most programs at all.  If
you really want the string instructions, use \-mstring.
.IP "\fB\-Oz\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Oz"
(\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0) Optimize for size, regardless of performance.
\&\fB\-Oz\fR enables the same optimization flags that \fB\-Os\fR
uses, but \fB\-Oz\fR also enables other optimizations intended solely
to reduce code size.  In particular, instructions that encode into
fewer bytes are preferred over longer instructions that execute in
fewer cycles.  \fB\-Oz\fR on Darwin is very similar to \fB\-Os\fR
in \s-1FSF\s0 distributions of \s-1GCC\s0.  \fB\-Oz\fR employs the same inlining
limits and avoids string instructions just like \fB\-Os\fR.
.Sp
If you use multiple \fB\-O\fR options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
.PP
Options of the form \fB\-f\fR\fIflag\fR specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of \fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed\-\-\-the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing \fBno\-\fR
or adding it.
.PP
The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by \fB\-O\fR options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when ``fine\-tuning'' of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (\*(C+ only).  Otherwise, when you specify

the member function name.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-defer\-pop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-defer-pop"
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function

On some machines, such as the \s-1VAX\s0, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro \f(CW\*(C`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED\*(C'\fR controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.

.IX Item "-fno-inline"
Don't pay attention to the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.
.IP "\fB\-finline\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-functions"
Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.
.Sp
If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

.IP "\fB\-finline\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-limit=n"
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  \fIn\fR is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of \fIn\fR is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with \*(C+.
.Sp
Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using \fB\-\-param\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR.
The \fB\-finline\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR option sets some of these parameters
as follows:

In C, emit \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR functions that are declared \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the

Emit variables declared \f(CW\*(C`static const\*(C'\fR when optimization isn't turned

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to

.IX Item "-fmerge-all-constants"
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
.Sp
This option implies \fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR.  In addition to
\&\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or \*(C+ require each non-automatic variable to
have distinct location, so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-fno\-branch\-count\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-branch-count-reg"
Do not use ``decrement and branch'' instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a

This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, \s-1IA\-64\s0 and S/390.

If the target supports a \s-1BSS\s0 section, \s-1GCC\s0 by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into \s-1BSS\s0.  This can save space in the resulting

This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the

For front-ends that support it (C and \*(C+), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/\*(C+
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (\fIlibmudflap\fR), which will be linked into a program if
\&\fB\-fmudflap\fR is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the \fB\s-1MUDFLAP_OPTIONS\s0\fR

Use \fB\-fmudflapth\fR instead of \fB\-fmudflap\fR to compile and to
link if your program is multi\-threaded.  Use \fB\-fmudflapir\fR, in
addition to \fB\-fmudflap\fR or \fB\-fmudflapth\fR, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows

.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies both
\&\fB\-fstrength\-reduce\fR and \fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  This

.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.

.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-ivs\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"
Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
Combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated than
a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not work at all

Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will use heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR, then the heuristics will be
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR are easier to understand.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fguess\-branch\-probability\fR at levels

.IX Item "-freorder-blocks-and-partition"
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.
.Sp
This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-functions"
Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections \f(CW\*(C`.text.hot\*(C'\fR for most frequently executed functions and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.text.unlikely\*(C'\fR for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.
.Sp
Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option effective.  See
\&\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR for details.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR, \fB\-Oz\fR (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0).
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;
\&        };

\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called ``type\-punning'') is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given an \f(CW\*(C`tree\*(C'\fR
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
\&\f(CW\*(C`c_get_alias_set\*(C'\fR.

with \fIunit-at-at-time\fR mode:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
enabling \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode may change the order
in which functions, variables, and top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements

though, can be replaced by \f(CW\*(C`section\*(C'\fR attributes.
.IP "*" 4
\&\fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode removes unreferenced static variables
and functions are removed.  This may result in undefined references
when an \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statement refers directly to variables or functions
that are otherwise unused.  In that case either the variable/function
shall be listed as an operand of the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statement operand or,
in the case of top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements the attribute \f(CW\*(C`used\*(C'\fR

.IP "*" 4
Static functions now can use non-standard passing conventions that

Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems

.RS 4
.IP "\fBsra-max-structure-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "sra-max-structure-size"
The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement
of aggregates (\s-1SRA\s0) optimization will perform block copies.  The
default value, 0, implies that \s-1GCC\s0 will select the most appropriate
size itself.
.IP "\fBsra-field-structure-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "sra-field-structure-ratio"
The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and
the complete structure size.  We say that if the ratio of the number
of bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the complete
structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.  The
default is 75.
.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This

crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
.IP "\fBmax-goto-duplication-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-goto-duplication-insns"
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, \s-1GCC\s0 factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-live-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-memory\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-memory"
The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in

needlessly consume memory and resources.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-single\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-single"
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in \s-1GCC\s0's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner

.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining

be applied.
The default value is 90.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining inlining is constrained by
\&\fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the

.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.

default value is 450.
.IP "\fBinline-call-cost\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-call-cost"
Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations
(having cost of 1).  Increasing this cost disqualify inlinining of non-leaf
functions and at same time increase size of leaf function that is believed to
reduce function size by being inlined.  In effect it increase amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the argumetns to other functions) and decrease inlining for code with low
abstraction penalty.  Default value is 16.

expansion.
.Sp
The \fBtracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback\fR is used only when profile

.IP "\fBggc-min-expand\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-expand"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM\s0 >= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\s0\*(R" is
the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_DATA\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_AS\*(C'\fR.  If
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
\&\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
.IP "\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-heapsize"
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by \fBggc-min-expand\fR% beyond \fBggc-min-heapsize\fR.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is the smaller of \s-1RAM/8\s0, \s-1RLIMIT_RSS\s0, or a limit which
tries to ensure that \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 or \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0 are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and \fBggc-min-expand\fR to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.

The second and third \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR should be in comments, but often are not

Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.
The rule has no commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.Sp
@anchor{dashMF}
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-dependency\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dependency-file"
Like \fB\-MF\fR. (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:

.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, including any path,
deletes any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and appends the platform's
usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MQ target"
Same as \fB\-MT\fR, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  \fB\-MQ\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.Sp
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it take the
basename of the input file and applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(but \f(CW@pxref\fR{dashMF,,\-MF}), but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
.IP "\fB\-MMD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MMD"
Like \fB\-MD\fR except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-preprocess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-preprocess"
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with \fB\-E\fR.  It inserts a special \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "<filename>"\*(C'\fR in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its filename.  When
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is in use, \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR and
loads the \s-1PCH\s0.
.Sp
This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to \s-1GCC\s0.  It is switched on by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
You should not write this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the \s-1PCH\s0 file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to \s-1GCC\s0's
current directory.

Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective\-C, Objective\-\*(C+, or assembly.  This has

extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been

conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the

Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will

emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is

Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output

You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a

In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro

Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the assembler.  You can use this to
supply system-specific assembler options which \s-1GCC\s0 does not know how to
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xassembler\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
.Sh "Options for Linking"
.IX Subsection "Options for Linking"
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
.PP
In addition to the options listed below, Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 also accepts and
passes nearly all of the options defined by the linker \fBld\fR and by
the library tool \fBlibtool\fR.  Common options include
\&\fB\-framework\fR, \fB\-dynamic\fR, \fB\-bundle\fR,
\&\fB\-flat_namespace\fR, and so forth.  See the ld and libtool man pages
for further details.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"

object file names should not be used as arguments.

.IX Item "-llibrary"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l library"
.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
.Sp
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Normally the files found this way are library files\-\-\-archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an \fB\-l\fR option and specifying a file name
is that \fB\-l\fR surrounds \fIlibrary\fR with \fBlib\fR and \fB.a\fR
and searches several directories.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostartfiles"
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-no\-c++filt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-c++filt"
By default all linker diagnostic output is piped through c++filt.
This option suppresses that behavior.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker.  The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
that \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.  (For example, \fB_\|_main\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors will be called.)
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a position independent executable on targets which support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
that were used to generate code (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this option.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
.Sp
This option will not work on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X unless all libraries (including
\&\fIlibgcc.a\fR) have also been compiled with \fB\-static\fR.  Since
neither a static version of libSystem.dylib nor crt0.o are provided, this
option is not useful to most people.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options that were used to
generate code (\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions)
when you specify this option.[1]
.Sp
This option is not supported on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ and \s-1GCJ\s0 drivers automatically add
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because \*(C+ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it will link the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or \s-1GCJ\s0 driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which \s-1GCC\s0 does not know how to
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u symbol"
Pretend the symbol \fIsymbol\fR is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use \fB\-u\fR multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
.Sh "Options for Directory Search"
.IX Subsection "Options for Directory Search"
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
.IP "\fB\-I\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Idir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use \fB\-isystem\fR for that).  If you use more than
one \fB\-I\fR option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the \fB\-nostdinc\fR and/or \fB\-isystem\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-iquote\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iquotedir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of \fB#include
"\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR; they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR,
otherwise just like \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fIcpp\fR, \fIcc1\fR, \fIas\fR and \fIld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The run-time support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults that the \fIgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fIcc1\fR,
\&\fIcc1plus\fR, \fIas\fR, \fIld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.IP "\fB\-I\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
This option has been deprecated.  Please use \fB\-iquote\fR instead for
\&\fB\-I\fR directories before the \fB\-I\-\fR and remove the \fB\-I\-\fR.
Any directories you specify with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I\-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I\-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.  (Ordinarily \fIall\fR \fB\-I\fR directories are used
this way.)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I\-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.  There is no way to
override this effect of \fB\-I\-\fR.  With \fB\-I.\fR you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-I\-\fR does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, \fB\-I\-\fR and \fB\-nostdinc\fR are
independent.
.Sh "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
.IX Subsection "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fIgcc\fR, or
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\fR when cross\-compiling, or
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\-<version>\fR to run a version other than the one that
was installed last.  Sometimes this is inconvenient, so \s-1GCC\s0 provides
options that will switch to another cross-compiler or version.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b machine"
The argument \fImachine\fR specifies the target machine for compilation.
.Sp
The value to use for \fImachine\fR is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring \s-1GCC\s0 as a cross\-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with \fBconfigure
i386v\fR, meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
would specify \fB\-b i386v\fR to run that cross compiler.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR \fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V version"
The argument \fIversion\fR specifies which version of \s-1GCC\s0 to run.
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
\&\fIversion\fR might be \fB2.0\fR, meaning to run \s-1GCC\s0 version 2.0.
.PP
The \fB\-V\fR and \fB\-b\fR options work by running the
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\-<version>\fR executable, so there's no real reason to
use them if you can just run that directly.
.Sh "Hardware Models and Configurations"
.IX Subsection "Hardware Models and Configurations"
Earlier we discussed the standard option \fB\-b\fR which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as \s-1VAX\s0 vs. 68000 vs. 80386.
.PP
In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with \fB\-m\fR, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations\-\-\-for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.
.PP
Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.
.PP
These options are defined by the macro \f(CW\*(C`TARGET_SWITCHES\*(C'\fR in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.
.PP
\fIDarwin Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Darwin Options"
.PP
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
.PP
\&\s-1FSF\s0 \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does not create ``universal'' object files; it will create
an object file for the single architecture that it was built to
target.  Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does create ``universal'' files if multiple
\&\fB\-arch\fR options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
\&\fIlipo\fR.
.PP
The subtype of the file created (like \fBppc7400\fR or \fBppc970\fR or
\&\fBi686\fR) is determined by the flags that specify the \s-1ISA\s0
that \s-1GCC\s0 is targetting, like \fB\-mcpu\fR or \fB\-march\fR.  The
\&\fB\-force_cpusubtype_ALL\fR option can be used to override this.
.PP
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an \s-1ISA\s0
mismatch.  The assembler, \fIas\fR, will only permit instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64\-bit instructions in an \fBppc750\fR object file.
The linker for shared libraries, \fI/usr/bin/libtool\fR, will fail
and print an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a \fBppc970\fR object file in a \fBppc7400\fR library).  The linker
for executables, \fIld\fR, will quietly give the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Fdir"
Add the framework directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by \fB\-I\fR options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.
.Sp
A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a \fB\*(L"Headers\*(R"\fR and/or
\&\fB\*(L"PrivateHeaders\*(R"\fR directory contained directly in it that ends
in \fB\*(L".framework\*(R"\fR.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the \fB\*(L".framework\*(R"\fR.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
\&\fB\*(L"Headers\*(R"\fR being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's \fB\*(L"Frameworks\*(R"\fR directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks, in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in \fB\*(L"/System/Library/Frameworks\*(R"\fR and
\&\fB\*(L"/Library/Frameworks\*(R"\fR.  An example include looks like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include <Framework/header.h>\*(C'\fR, where \fBFramework\fR denotes
the name of the framework and header.h is found in the
\&\fB\*(L"PrivateHeaders\*(R"\fR or \fB\*(L"Headers\*(R"\fR directory.

.RS 4
.IP "\fB387\fR" 4
.IX Item "387"
Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option will run almost everywhere.
The temporary results are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision
specified by the type resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips.  See \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for more detailed description.
.Sp
This is the default choice for i386 compiler.
.IP "\fBsse\fR" 4
.IX Item "sse"
Use scalar floating point instructions present in the \s-1SSE\s0 instruction set.
This instruction set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the \s-1AMD\s0 line
by Athlon\-4, Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of \s-1SSE\s0
instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics, thus the double and
extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.  Later version, present
only in Pentium4 and the future \s-1AMD\s0 x86\-64 chips supports double precision
arithmetics too.
.Sp
For the i386 compiler, you need to use \fB\-march=\fR\fIcpu-type\fR, \fB\-msse\fR
or \fB\-msse2\fR switches to enable \s-1SSE\s0 extensions and make this option
effective.  For the x86\-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.
.Sp
The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80bit.
.Sp
This is the default choice for the x86\-64 compiler.
.IP "\fBsse,387\fR" 4
.IX Item "sse,387"
Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively double the
amount of available registers and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and \s-1SSE\s0 the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the \s-1GCC\s0 register allocator does not model separate
functional units well resulting in instable performance.

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not part of \s-1GCC\s0.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross\-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for

\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-ret\-in\-387\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-ret-in-387"
Do not use the \s-1FPU\s0 registers for return values of functions.

The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
\&\f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR in an \s-1FPU\s0 register, even if there
is no \s-1FPU\s0.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an \s-1FPU\s0.
.Sp
The option \fB\-mno\-fp\-ret\-in\-387\fR causes such values to be returned
in ordinary \s-1CPU\s0 registers instead.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fancy\-math\-387\fR" 4

Some 387 emulators do not support the \f(CW\*(C`sin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cos\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`sqrt\*(C'\fR instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when \fB\-march\fR
indicates that the target cpu will always have an \s-1FPU\s0 and so the
instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR switch.

Control whether \s-1GCC\s0 aligns \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`long long\*(C'\fR variables on a two word boundary or a one word
boundary.  Aligning \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR variables on a two word boundary will
produce code that runs somewhat faster on a \fBPentium\fR at the
expense of more memory.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR if you use the \fB\-malign\-double\fR switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.
.IP "\fB\-m96bit\-long\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m96bit-long-double"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m128bit-long-double"
.PD
These switches control the size of \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR type.  The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so \fB\-m96bit\-long\-double\fR is the default in 32 bit mode.
.Sp
Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the \s-1ABI\s0, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
\&\fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR will align \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to a 16 byte boundary by padding the \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR with an additional
32 bit zero.
.Sp
In the x86\-64 compiler, \fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR is the default choice as
its \s-1ABI\s0 specifies that \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.
.Sp
Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR if you override the default value for your target \s-1ABI\s0, the
structures and arrays containing \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR variables will change
their size as well as function calling convention for function taking
\&\f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary
compatible with arrays or structures in code compiled without that switch.
.IP "\fB\-msvr3\-shlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msvr3-shlib"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-svr3\-shlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-svr3-shlib"
.PD
Control whether \s-1GCC\s0 places uninitialized local variables into the
\&\f(CW\*(C`bss\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`data\*(C'\fR segments.  \fB\-msvr3\-shlib\fR places them
into \f(CW\*(C`bss\*(C'\fR.  These options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.
.IP "\fB\-mrtd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mrtd"
Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the \f(CW\*(C`ret\*(C'\fR \fInum\fR
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.
.Sp
You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute \fBstdcall\fR.  You can also
override the \fB\-mrtd\fR option by using the function attribute
\&\fBcdecl\fR.  
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.
.Sp
Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.
.Sp
In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)
.IP "\fB\-mregparm=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mregparm=num"
Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute \fBregparm\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR if you use this switch, and
\&\fInum\fR is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.
.IP "\fB\-mstackrealign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstackrealign"
Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the
\&\fB\-mstackrealign\fR option will generate an alternate
prologue/epilogue that realigns the runtime stack.  This supports
mixing legacy codes that keep a 4\-byte aligned stack with modern codes
that keep a 16\-byte stack for \s-1SSE\s0 compatibility.  The alternate
prologue and epilogue are slower and bigger than the regular ones, and
they require one dedicated register for the entire function.  This
also lowers the number of registers available if used in conjunction
with the \f(CW\*(C`regparm\*(C'\fR attribute.  Nested functions encountered while
\&\fB\-mstackrealign\fR is on will generate warnings, and they will
not realign the stack when called.
.IP "\fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num"
Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to \fInum\fR
byte boundary.  If \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary\fR is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits), except when optimizing for code
size (\fB\-Os\fR or \fB\-Oz\fR (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)), in which case the default is the minimum correct
alignment (4 bytes for x86, and 8 bytes for x86\-64).
.Sp
On Pentium and PentiumPro, \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR values
should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see \fB\-malign\-double\fR) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium \s-1III\s0, the
Streaming \s-1SIMD\s0 Extension (\s-1SSE\s0) data type \f(CW\*(C`_\|_m128\*(C'\fR suffers similar
penalties if it is not 16 byte aligned.
.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.
.Sp
This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=2\fR.

Use \s-1PUSH\s0 operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter

.IP "\fB\-maccumulate\-outgoing\-args\fR" 4

If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments will be

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This

\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports two related instruction set architectures for the
\&\s-1RS/6000\s0 and PowerPC.  The \fI\s-1POWER\s0\fR instruction set are those
instructions supported by the \fBrios\fR chip set used in the original
\&\s-1RS/6000\s0 systems and the \fIPowerPC\fR instruction set is the
architecture of the Motorola MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the \s-1IBM\s0 4xx microprocessors.
.Sp
Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An \s-1MQ\s0
register is included in processors supporting the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring \s-1GCC\s0.  Specifying the
\&\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the \fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR option
rather than the options listed above.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpower\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture and to use the \s-1MQ\s0 register.
Specifying \fB\-mpower2\fR implies \fB\-power\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0
to generate instructions that are present in the \s-1POWER2\s0 architecture but
not the original \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpowerpc\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32\-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
Specifying \fB\-mpowerpc\-gpopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mpowerpc\-gfxopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0 to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the additional
64\-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64\-bit, doubleword quantities.  \s-1GCC\s0 defaults to
\&\fB\-mno\-powerpc64\fR.
.Sp
If you specify both \fB\-mno\-power\fR and \fB\-mno\-powerpc\fR, \s-1GCC\s0
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special \s-1AIX\s0 common-mode calls, and will not use
the \s-1MQ\s0 register.  Specifying both \fB\-mpower\fR and \fB\-mpowerpc\fR
permits \s-1GCC\s0 to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the \s-1MQ\s0 register; specify this for the Motorola \s-1MPC601\s0.

Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.  With

assembler mnemonics defined for the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.  Instructions
defined in only one architecture have only one mnemonic; \s-1GCC\s0 uses that
mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is specified.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
use.  Specifying \fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR sometimes overrides the
value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross\-compiler, you
should normally not specify either \fB\-mnew\-mnemonics\fR or
\&\fB\-mold\-mnemonics\fR, but should instead accept the default.

\&\fB\-mcpu=common\fR selects a completely generic processor.  Code
generated under this option will run on any \s-1POWER\s0 or PowerPC processor.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures, and will not use the \s-1MQ\s0 register.  \s-1GCC\s0 assumes a generic
processor model for scheduling purposes.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=power\fR, \fB\-mcpu=power2\fR, \fB\-mcpu=powerpc\fR, and
\&\fB\-mcpu=powerpc64\fR specify generic \s-1POWER\s0, \s-1POWER2\s0, pure 32\-bit
PowerPC (i.e., not \s-1MPC601\s0), and 64\-bit PowerPC architecture machine
types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed for

\&\fB\-mpowerpc\-gpopt\fR, \fB\-mpowerpc\-gfxopt\fR,
\&\fB\-mstring\fR.  The particular options set for any particular \s-1CPU\s0
will vary between compiler versions, depending on what setting seems
to produce optimal code for that \s-1CPU\s0; it doesn't necessarily reflect
the actual hardware's capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual
option to a particular value, you may specify it after the
\&\fB\-mcpu\fR option, like \fB\-mcpu=970 \-mno\-altivec\fR.
.Sp
On \s-1AIX\s0, the \fB\-maltivec\fR and \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR options are
not enabled or disabled by the \fB\-mcpu\fR option at present, since
\&\s-1AIX\s0 does not have full support for these options.  You may still

Enable (or disable) built-in compiler support for the syntactic extensions as
well as operations and predicates defined in the Motorola AltiVec
Technology Programming Interface Manual (\s-1PIM\s0).  This includes the
recognition of \f(CW\*(C`vector\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pixel\*(C'\fR as (context\-dependent)
keywords, the definition of built-in functions such as \f(CW\*(C`vec_add\*(C'\fR,
and the use of parenthesized comma expression as AltiVec literals.
Note that unlike the option \fB\-maltivec\fR, the extension does not require
the inclusion of any special header files; if \f(CW\*(C`<altivec.h>\*(C'\fR is included,
a warning will be issued and the contents of the header will be
ignored.  The preprocessor shall provide an \f(CW\*(C`_\|_APPLE_ALTIVEC_\|_\*(C'\fR
manifest constant when \fB\-mpim\-altivec\fR is specified.  (\s-1APPLE\s0 \s-1ONLY\s0)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-mpim\-altivec\fR option disables the inlining of
functions containing AltiVec instructions into functions that do not make
use of the vector unit.  Certain other optimizations, such as inline 
vectorization of \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR calls, are also disabled.
These adjustments make it possible to compile programs whose use of AltiVec
instructions is preceded by a run-time check for the presence of AltiVec
functionality, and that can therefore be made to run on G3 processors.
Note that all of these optimizations may be re-enabled by supplying
the \fB\-maltivec\fR option, or an \fB\-mcpu\fR option specifying
a processor that supports AltiVec instructions.

Modify generation of the \s-1TOC\s0 (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The \fB\-mfull\-toc\fR option is selected by
default.  In that case, \s-1GCC\s0 will allocate at least one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  \s-1GCC\s0
will also place floating-point constants in the \s-1TOC\s0.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the \s-1TOC\s0.
.Sp
If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available \s-1TOC\s0 space, you can reduce the amount of \s-1TOC\s0 space used
with the \fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR options.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the \s-1TOC\s0.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes \s-1GCC\s0 to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving \s-1TOC\s0 space.
.Sp
If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of
these options, specify \fB\-mminimal\-toc\fR instead.  This option causes
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to make only one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little \s-1TOC\s0 space.  You may wish to use this option

Default to making all function calls indirectly, using a register, so
that functions which reside further than 32 megabytes (33,554,432
bytes) from the current location can be called.  This setting can be
overridden by the \f(CW\*(C`shortcall\*(C'\fR function attribute, or by
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall(0)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the \s-1AIX\s0 linker can do this,
as can the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for 32\-bit PowerPC systems as well.
.Sp
On Darwin/PPC systems, \f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall\*(C'\fR will generate ``jbsr
callee, L42'', plus a ``branch island'' (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the ``branch island''.  The
Darwin/PPC linker will prefer the first address and generate a ``bl
callee'' if the \s-1PPC\s0 ``bl'' instruction will reach the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker will generate ``bl L42'' to call the ``branch
island''.  The ``branch island'' is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32\-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.
.Sp
On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, \fB\-mlongcall\fR directs the compiler
emit to the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides
whether to use or discard it.  \fB\-mlong\-branch\fR is a synonym for

.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4

Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 will enable it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4

Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared

constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000\s0.  The 386 has no such limit.)

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V

.IP "\fB\-fpack\-struct[=\fR\fIn\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpack-struct[=n]"
Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this will be output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fpack\-struct\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions"
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_return_address\*(C'\fR does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
\&                                       void *call_site);
\&        void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
\&                                       void *call_site);
.Ve
.Sp
The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \fBextern inline\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-check"
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system must do that.  The switch causes generation of code
to ensure that the operating system sees the stack being extended.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-limit\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4

.IX Item "-fno-stack-limit"
.PD
Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
.Sp
For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address \fB0x80000000\fR
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
\&\fB\-fstack\-limit\-symbol=_\|_stack_limit\fR and
\&\fB\-Wl,\-\-defsym,_\|_stack_limit=0x7ffe0000\fR to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.

This option and its counterpart, \fB\-fno\-leading\-underscore\fR, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fleading\-underscore\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to

The default without \fB\-fpic\fR is \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR; with
\&\fB\-fpic\fR the default is \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility=\fR\fIdefault|internal|hidden|protected\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility=default|internal|hidden|protected"
Set the default \s-1ELF\s0 image symbol visibility to the specified option\-\-\-all
symbols will be marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect \s-1API\s0 export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is \fBstrongly\fR recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
.Sp
Despite the nomenclature, \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR always means public ie;
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
\&\f(CW\*(C`protected\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`internal\*(C'\fR are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option will be \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR.
The default if \fB\-fvisibility\fR isn't specified is
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR, i.e., make every
symbol public\-\-\-this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
\&\s-1GCC\s0.
.Sp
A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring \s-1ELF\s0
symbols have the correct visibility is given by ``How To Write
Shared Libraries'' by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<\fBhttp://people.redhat.com/~drepper/\fR>)\-\-\-however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with \s-1DLL\s0's on Windows and with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility("default")))\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllexport)\*(C'\fR you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
.Sp
For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(hidden)\fR and
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility pop\fR.  These can be nested up to sixteen
times.  Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed \fBas
part of the \s-1API\s0 interface contract\fR and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default ie; declarations
only for use within the local \s-1DSO\s0 should \fBalways\fR be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid \s-1PLT\s0 indirection overheads\-\-\-making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(default)\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp

is at <\fBhttp://www.nedprod.com/programs/gccvisibility.html\fR>.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information that allow \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 will search
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR where it would normally search \fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.

.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
